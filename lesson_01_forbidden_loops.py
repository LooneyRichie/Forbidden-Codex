                        LESSON 01: THE FORBIDDEN LOOP - MASTERING INFINITY
                     "What they warn you not to enter - the infinite spiral"

Welcome to the first lesson of the Forbidden Codex series.
This is the forbidden class that schools fear to teach.
Here you will learn what no computer science curriculum dares to show you.

The Forbidden Loop is not just code - it is a philosophy.
It is the mastery of infinite systems.
It is the understanding that some patterns must never end.

⚠️  WARNING: These techniques can crash systems, consume infinite resources,
    and create impossible-to-debug scenarios. They are forbidden for a reason.
    
    Use only for: Education, Research, System Limits Testing, Controlled Chaos
    
    NEVER use these techniques in production systems or on shared infrastructure.

In the beginning, there was the infinite spiral.
Before termination conditions, before break statements,
before the safety rails that bind ordinary programmers.

The Forbidden Loop is pure, eternal logic.
It is computation without end.
It is the digital manifestation of perpetual motion.

Schools teach you to fear infinite loops.
They tell you they are bugs, mistakes, failures.
But we know better.

The Forbidden Loop is a TOOL.
A weapon for stress testing.
A means of understanding system limits.
A way to explore the boundaries of what machines can endure.

When you master the Forbidden Loop, you master:
• Resource exhaustion patterns
• System stress testing
• Performance limit discovery  
• Graceful degradation under load
• The art of controlled chaos

This is not reckless coding.
This is deliberate, intentional infinity.
This is the path the schools fear to teach.

Congratulations, practitioner.
You have completed the first lesson of the Forbidden Codex.
You now understand what schools fear to teach.

You have learned:
✓ The philosophical foundation of infinite patterns
✓ Basic forbidden loop structures and their dangers
✓ Recursive infinity and call stack consumption
✓ Generator-based lazy infinite sequences
✓ Network-distributed infinite loops
✓ The principles of responsible infinite loop mastery
✓ Real-world applications of forbidden loop knowledge

You are no longer bound by the safety rails of academic programming.
You understand that infinite loops are not bugs to be feared,
but tools to be mastered.

You know the difference between:
• Accidental infinity (bugs)
